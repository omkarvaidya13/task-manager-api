Technical Stack: Node.js, Postman, Jest.js, SendGrid, REST API, MongoDB

Aim: To learn and understand how to use the concept of Representational state transfer(REST) and develop a task manager application.

A task manager is built that will help users to manage their tasks. The operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete are done using REST API.

The tasks are specific to each individual user. The backend database used is MongoDB and the code is written in Node.js.

The task manager is also integrated with SendGrid, which helps to send out emails to welcome users whenever a new user is created.

Used Postman to request and perform the operations of adding, deleting, and editing the tasks for different users. The user authentication is done with the help of JSON Web Tokens.
